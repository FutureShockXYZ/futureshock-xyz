Future shock happens when we are bombarded with more information than we can process, when too much is changing too fast, and we feel overwhelmed by a feeling of malaise and confusion. But Future Shock is also an opportunity to recognize that we are quickly innovating solutions to previously unsolvable problems â€” problems that will allow us to build the world we want.


> Future shock is the dizzying disorientation brought on by the premature arrival of the future.

> We create an environment so ephemeral, unfamiliar and complex as to threaten millions with adaptive breakdown. This breakdown is future shock.

> We may define future shock as the distress, both physical and psychological, that arises from an overload of the human organism's physical adaptive systems and its decision-making processes. Put more simply, future shock is the human response to overstimulation.

The site has quite a neat technical setup in the background. I've actually liked it so much that I've decided to keep the repository public and write short documentation so others can create similar small-scale syndication operations.
