Future shock happens when we are bombarded with more information than we can process, when too much is changing too fast, and we feel overwhelmed by a feeling of malaise and confusion.

The name pays homage to the visionary book Future Shock published in 1970. It was written by a futurist Alvin Toffler.


The site has quite a neat technical setup in the background. I've actually liked it so much that I've decided to keep the repository public and write short documentation so others can create similar small-scale syndication operations.
